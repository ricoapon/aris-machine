  <h2>Auto complete</h2>
  <demo-code-editor [heightInNrOfLines]="4"
                    [scenarioEvents]="scenarioBuilder().typeText('loo').openSuggestions().acceptSuggestion().build()">
    Suggestions are automatically made while typing, and you can also press <span class='hotkeys'>CTRL + SPACE</span>
    for showing all possible suggestions. You can press <span class='hotkeys'>TAB</span> or <span
    class='hotkeys'>ENTER</span> keys to choose the suggestion.
  </demo-code-editor>

  <demo-code-editor [heightInNrOfLines]="2"
                    [scenarioEvents]="scenarioBuilder()
                      .typeText('m')
                      .openSuggestions()
                      .acceptSuggestion()
                      .typeText('input')
                      .nextSnippetPlaceholder()
                      .typeText('0')
                      .nextSnippetPlaceholder()
                      .build()">
    Some functions are filled in using a snippet that uses placeholders. After By pressing <span
    class='hotkeys'>TAB</span> you can go to the next placeholder. After the last placeholder, you can press <span
    class='hotkeys'>TAB</span> again to finish filling in the snippet. After finishing, you can see that the
    highlighting of the placeholders is removed.

  <h2>Documentation on hover</h2>
  <!-- The popup goes out of the editor (which is fine by itself), but this overlaps with any text you place before it.
  To avoid that, we just enter a lot of enters. -->

  <demo-code-editor [heightInNrOfLines]="8"
                    [scenarioEvents]="scenarioBuilder()
                      .typeText('\n\n\n\n\n\ninput')
                      .wait(500)
                      .showHover()
                      .hideHover()
                      .build()">
    Documentation about each of the keywords is included in the game. It is annoying to keep switching to the
    documentation page. So it is included in the editor! By hovering over a keyword with the mouse, you get the relevant
    documentation. Or you could place your cursor on the word and press <span class='hotkeys'>CTRL + Q</span>.<p></p>
    <p></p>Note for people having experience with the Monaco editor: the default hotkey is <span class='hotkeys'>CTRL + K CTRL + I</span>
    (pressing two combinations after each other). This still works, but is not very practical. To make the documentation
    easier to access, the additional hotkey <span class='hotkeys'>CTRL + Q</span> is added.
